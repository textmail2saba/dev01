Kubernetes
==========

 - K8 is container management Technology developed by google.

 - K8 comes with cacbablity of automating deloyment, scaling of application and operatings of application containers across clusters.  it is capable of creating centric infrastructure.

Feature
-------
   - continouse deployment, intergration and development.
   - containeraized infrastructure.
   - Application centric management
   - Auto scal up feature.
   - Environment consistance across development testing and prodcution.
   

Installation:
------------
 it will support to run app in VM, pyshical and cloud environment. further it removes host-centric app to containeraized centric app.

K8-Architecture
---------------
Master / Nodes

Master
------
Etcd, API Server, Scheduler and COntrol manager.

Etcd - It stores the information about nodes configuration and only acecessable by API Server as its handle sensitive information

API Server - kubernetes is an API server which provides all the operations on cluster using API. API server implements an interface , librarires and set of tools to be readily communicate with it. kubeconfig will reveals the tools .

schedular - responsible for allocating pods to new node and utlization tracking.

Control manager - it responsible for most of the collector which regulates cluster state and performs a cluster. 
key controllers are endpoint, replication , namespace and service account controller.


Node
----
DOcker, kubelet and k8 proxy 

Docker- isolated container for an encapsulated applications.
kubelet -  manage pods on node, volume, secret and creating new containers
k8proxy - responsible for pods network componants


OD
Namespace kubernets - its an external qualification to the cluster when multiple teams access.
-------------------

Node - its configuration required to run pod service on it such as docker,kubelet and k8proxy.
---

K8 - Service - its a logical set of pods, its an abstraction on the top of pod which provides a single IP address -------------
and DNS.
  - By service DNS load balancing is easily achieved.

PODS- pod is a collection of containers and its storage running in node.
----
k8- replication controller

k8- deployment controller - its a higher version of replication controller.

K8 volume - it doesn't has any limitations over pod and supports multiple volume at the same time.
---------

k8- Secrets - k8 objects used to store data like user/password  with encryption.

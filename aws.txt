EBS
===
General purpose 3000 to 10000 IOPS
proisioned IOPS - 10000IPS more
Throughput optimized
cold disk
magnetic disk

Billing alarm - you can set perdefined amount to alert
------------
ELB
---
cloud watch - Resource logs and monitoring ELB, EC2 , Route53 etc.
Cloud Trial - ApI audit logs
Access logs - ELB logs stored on S3 where can store about ec2 instance deleted
Request tracing - stored logs about applicatiob ELB on S3

Resource group: region based to tag punch of instance

Pricing model
---------------
on-demand
Reserverd instance
Spot instance
Dedicated instance

AWS Config - is region based <==> Stores Resource inventory, configuration history, config change notification and security complaince
----------

health dashboard
-----------------
service health dashboard
personal health dashboard

ELB
====
Application load balancer works in layer 7, (http/https), advanced routing technique like sending request to specifed webserver.
network load balancer works at layer4(tcp) , most expensive and extreme performance ( Static IP address)
classic load balancer - operates on both- deprecated. http/https/tcp

 contact aws while overloading (prewarm)
ALB behind Network load balancer.

aws Systems manager - its kind of overrall insight portal for aws cloud services.
-------------------
Trusted advisor - kind of recommandation for compliance like cost, performance, security, service etc..
Resource 


placement groups - placed instances in different hardware
---------------
cluster instance - are created in single availablity zone(AZ)
partition: logically created in each diffrent rack. multi- AZ
spread instance on each rack

Elasticity and scalablity
========================
Elasticity - inscrease the size of instance as required like small to medium as RI instance(Short term)
Scalablity - increase the number of instance while going spike traffic.(Long Term)

Dynamo DB(no sql key pair)
--------
scalablity - increase the IOPS if required.
eslaticity - unlimited storage

RDS
---
scalablity - cant do much
elasticity - increase size from small to medium

Aurora
------
scalablity - modify from small to medium
Elasticity - aurora  serverless

RDS-Multiaz - failover AZ by reboot the instance

RDS read replicate - supports mysql,postgresql and mariaDB, Aurora( maximum 5 replicate)

Elasticache- AWS ElastiCache is a software used to deploy, run and scale popular open source compatible in-memory data stores, example-Game, finance,ad, health service etc.

DynamoDB -  is aligned with the values of Serverless applications: automatic scaling according to your application load, pay-per-what-you-use pricing, easy to get started with, and no servers to manage
         - serverless  and no patch , no provision, no manage etc.. 

Aurora - serverless -  relational DB and compatible with mysql/posgres- auto scaling

CloudFront - CDN serve webpages to different AZ users

S3 - object storage , file size 0 -5TB, key value store. key(name of file) value(data)


KMS & CloudHSM
=============== - Generate , backup and store keys
KMS - multi-tenency - synchronised keys
cloudHSM - Appliance based and secure - asynchronised.


Snowball & Snowball Edge
========================
snowball is offline storage
snowball edge has some compute functionality with storage.

Storage Gateway - installed as a virtual appliance in datacentre in (hyper-v/vmware esxi)
===============
file gateway - just flat file as an object storage supports NFS/SMB..
volume gateway - storage volume(ISCSI) - data stores in locally and backup only stores in aws - backup as EBS 		 snapshot
		- cache volume - primarily stores in aws and cache only in locally.
virtual tape library - stores all the data into s3 and then archives to glacier.


Athena - is an interactive query service to anlyse and query data located in S3 using standard SQL.
	 serverless, generate business reports, analyse AWS cost and reports

EFS - is network file system(NFS/SMB)- multiple ec2 instalnce can access across region.


VPC (Logical/virtual datacenter in AWS) 
===
-Launch instance into a subnet you choosing
- assign custom IP address ranges in each subnet
-configure route table between subnets - where who needs to speak other subnets
-create internet gateway to attach it to our VPC
much better security control over your aws resource

default VPC is user-friendly allowiing you to immediately deploy instances

VPC Peering
-----------
allows you to connect one VPC with another via a direct network route using private IP Addresses.
you can peer VPC with other aws accounts as well as with other VPCs in the same account


1subnet = 1 availablity zone
security groups are statefull,network ACL are stateless

VPC -   when  VPC creation, route tables

VPC Endpoing - which provides connection between two aws resource via private subnets.
NAT Gateway - which provides internet trafffic to ec2 instance in private subnet.
ACL - provide security over Entire network level security
Security group - provide security over instance.

AWS Direct Connect  - is a network service that allows you to create a private connection from your Data centre to your AWS VPC by BGP protocol
